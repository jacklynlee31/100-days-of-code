# 100-days-of-code
The <a href="https://twitter.com/elleluna/status/722483522213023744">100 Day Project</a> starts on April 19th and ends on July 27th.

Every day I will be writing code (outside of my usual coding for work) and tracking it through this repository.

(All of the code will eventually migrate to this repository, but for right now I'm using CodePen.)

My main goal for this is to build up my little to non-existant JavaScript and jQuery skills. 
I'm also going to try to focus on vue.js, which is what we will be using more frequently at my place of work.

<b>I strongly believe that coding is an art.</b> It is possible to code creatively, and I hope to show that through this project.

<h3>Day One</h3>

Kicking off this project with a super simple exercise. I have done more complicated JavaScript and jQuery work in the past, but I haven't practiced it as much as I should since getting a job and diving head-first into all things Laravel/PHP. So I decided to start with something that I know how to do - clicking on an element and toggling the class. Check it out.

<h3>Day Two</h3>

For the second day, I went back to a project I did while at The Iron Yard - creating a keyboard. I built it without looking at my old project. The biggest misstep for me was trying to use 'html' and 'text' instead of 'innerHTML.' Once I figured that out, it was smooth sailing.

Dropdown menus have always been horrible for me. I could never understand the right way to nest things, or how to get the scripts to work properly. I thought this would take me a long time, but I got it to work pretty fast. I understand coding and code structure better, so maybe that helped me out for this.

Playing around with transitions, transforms and webkit filters. This is all done in CSS. A lot of the sites I work on utilize these kinds of effects in order to improve user experience. I'm usually working on the back-end of things, though, so I don't get to do a lot of CSS work. Wondering if CSS is best practice, or if these are effects best handled by a script. I'm thinking CSS is more practical, but I could be wrong. I'll have to look into it.

<h3>Day Five</h3>

I'm realizing that all my ideas for projects during these 100 days might be too easy. I've found jQuery UI, and it is absolutely amazing. One line of code allows you to do a hundred different things. I'm going to try to up the difficulty level on these projects so that I'm not just writing one line of code and calling it a day. In this project I have the 'draggable' function demonstrated in 3 different ways.

I have done a modal before, but it was for a client and it was my first time trying it out. Creating it this time around was a lot easier. Modals, or modal-like features, are used a lot on websites these days. In my opinion, they are much cleaner and, in some ways, easier to implement than pop-ups.

<br><br>
Followed a simple tutorial to make a ticking clock. There are still a few bugs I need to fix on this one. I've built a clock before, but I didn't do it quite this way, if I remember correctly. Either way, I like how it turned out.
