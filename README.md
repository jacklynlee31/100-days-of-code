# 100-days-of-code
The <a href="https://twitter.com/elleluna/status/722483522213023744">100 Day Project</a> starts on April 19th and ends on July 27th.

Every day I will be writing code (outside of my usual coding for work) and tracking it through this repository.

(All of the code will eventually migrate to this repository, but for right now I'm using CodePen.)

My main goal for this is to build up my little to non-existant JavaScript and jQuery skills. 
I'm also going to try to focus on vue.js, which is what we will be using more frequently at my place of work.

<b>I strongly believe that coding is an art.</b> It is possible to code creatively, and I hope to show that through this project.

<h3>Day One</h3>

Kicking off this project with a super simple exercise. I have done more complicated JavaScript and jQuery work in the past, but I haven't practiced it as much as I should since getting a job and diving head-first into all things Laravel/PHP. So I decided to start with something that I know how to do - clicking on an element and toggling the class. Check it out.

<h3>Day Two</h3>

For the second day, I went back to a project I did while at The Iron Yard - creating a keyboard. I built it without looking at my old project. The biggest misstep for me was trying to use 'html' and 'text' instead of 'innerHTML.' Once I figured that out, it was smooth sailing.

<h3>Day Three</h3>

Dropdown menus have always been horrible for me. I could never understand the right way to nest things, or how to get the scripts to work properly. I thought this would take me a long time, but I got it to work pretty fast. I understand coding and code structure better, so maybe that helped me out for this.

Playing around with transitions, transforms and webkit filters. This is all done in CSS. A lot of the sites I work on utilize these kinds of effects in order to improve user experience. I'm usually working on the back-end of things, though, so I don't get to do a lot of CSS work. Wondering if CSS is best practice, or if these are effects best handled by a script. I'm thinking CSS is more practical, but I could be wrong. I'll have to look into it.

<h3>Day Five</h3>

<br>
I'm realizing that all my ideas for projects during these 100 days might be too easy. I've found jQuery UI, and it is absolutely amazing. One line of code allows you to do a hundred different things. I'm going to try to up the difficulty level on these projects so that I'm not just writing one line of code and calling it a day. In this project I have the 'draggable' function demonstrated in 3 different ways.

<h3>Day Six</h3>

<br><br>
I have done a modal before, but it was for a client and it was my first time trying it out. Creating it this time around was a lot easier. Modals, or modal-like features, are used a lot on websites these days. In my opinion, they are much cleaner and, in some ways, easier to implement than pop-ups.
<br><br>
<h3>Day Seven</h3>

<br><br>
Followed a simple tutorial to make a ticking clock. There are still a few bugs I need to fix on this one. I've built a clock before, but I didn't do it quite this way, if I remember correctly. Either way, I like how it turned out.
<br><br>
<h3>Day Eight</h3>

<br><br>
Followed another tutorial to create a photo slider. The photos change after a set number of seconds, using a transition to fade from one to the next. I'm sure you could use the same principles to create a photo slider that you manually change using arrows or something similar.
<br><br>

<br><br>
We are beginning to implement vue.js at work. We haven't started 100%, but we are playing around with it and dipping our toes in the water. I've been looking around for a simple way to create a ToDo list using javaScript/jQuery but couldn't find anything that felt 'simple' enough. I decided to dig into vue.js and was surprised at how easy it was. I'm looking forward to playing with it more.
<br><br>
<h3>Day 10</h3>

<br><br>
Used vue.js to create a simple navigation menu. I'm starting to learn just how much vue.js can do with a minimal amount of code. Everything I've done so far with vue.js has been both simple and dynamic - meaning, changes don't happen after a form is processed or a page is refreshed. I'm going to continue on with learning some more vue.js skills for now.
<br><br>
<h3>Day 11</h3>

<br><br>
I hate to admit that I'm behind on this project, but I am. I'm trying to catch up as much as I can this week and finish up any outstanding days this weekend. For Day 11 I continued playing with vue.js and created a very simple in-screen editor. You click the content, type whatever you want in the box, and it dynamically updates.
<br><br>
<h3>Day 12</h3>

<br><br>
I actually did something similar to this project for one of our clients. He just wanted the ability to switch from a grid view to a list view and back again. I suspected that there was a way to accomplish this using vue.js, and I was right. Vue just makes everything a little bit cleaner and easier to toggle.
<br><br>
<h3>Day 13</h3>

<br><br>
Still catching up! This one is another version of the editor I did previously. The difference being that this is a Markdown Editor, so you can use tags to create your content. Again, the content dynamically updates without re-loading the page.
<br><br>
<h3>Day 14</h3>
<a href="http://codepen.io/jacklynlee31/pen/mPabWb">Click Here to View the CodePen</a><br><br>

<br><br>
Now I think I'm caught up? Regardless, this one was fun. I use DataTables a lot in projects because it's an easy way to create a table in Laravel that not only looks clean, but functions in a way where anyone can use it. I was wondering if there was a way to build a sortable table that didn't require a huge amount of code. Lo and behold, I found that vue.js can be used to do just that!
